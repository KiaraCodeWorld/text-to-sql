AWS Service / Component,Purpose in Architecture,Why Chosen (Strengths),Best Fit For Use Case,Possible Alternatives & Trade-offs
Amazon S3 (Raw & Processed Buckets),Central storage for raw and transformed data. Acts as data lake.,"Scalable, durable (11 nines), cost-effective, integrates natively with all AWS analytics tools.","Ideal for storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale.",Alternatives: EFS or FSx (for file systems) — not as scalable for data lake.
AWS Glue,"ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service to clean, transform, and catalog data.","Serverless ETL, auto-scales, deeply integrates with S3, Athena, and Redshift.",Ideal for data preparation and building data catalogs automatically.,"Alternatives: AWS Data Pipeline, EMR, Apache Spark on EC2 — but require more management and cost."
AWS Glue Data Catalog,Central metadata repository for datasets.,"Automatically integrates with Glue, Athena, Redshift Spectrum.",Enables schema discovery and queryability across multiple tools.,Alternatives: Apache Hive Metastore — less integrated and requires manual setup.
Amazon Athena,Interactive query service to analyze S3 data using SQL.,"Serverless, no infrastructure, pay-per-query, and integrates directly with Glue Data Catalog.",Perfect for ad-hoc querying of S3 data without loading into a database.,"Alternatives: Redshift Spectrum, Presto, or EMR — require more cost or admin overhead."
Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL),Relational database for processed/curated data used by APIs.,"Fully managed, highly available, 5x faster than standard PostgreSQL.",Great for transactional workloads and serving structured data to APIs.,"Alternatives: RDS PostgreSQL (less scalable), DynamoDB (NoSQL – not relational)."
AWS Lambda,Executes serverless functions for asynchronous processing and API integration.,"No server management, scales automatically, event-driven execution.","Ideal for lightweight logic between Aurora, APIs, and S3.",Alternatives: ECS Fargate (containerized compute – overkill for small functions).
Amazon QuickSight,Visualization and BI dashboarding tool.,"Serverless BI, integrates with Athena, Aurora, and S3.",Great for self-service analytics and data visualization.,"Alternatives: Power BI, Tableau – require separate licensing and integration."
AWS IAM Roles,Securely manage access and permissions across AWS resources.,"Centralized, fine-grained control, integrates natively with all AWS services.",Ensures principle of least privilege and secure data access.,Alternatives: Custom authentication or AD Federation – adds complexity.
AWS Key Management Service (KMS),Encrypts data at rest and in transit using managed keys.,"Fully managed encryption, integrates with S3, Aurora, Glue, and more.",Ensures compliance and data protection across AWS.,Alternatives: CloudHSM (hardware security – costlier and complex).
APSync / API Gateway,Provides secure API access for Benefits and Claims APIs.,"Serverless, scalable, integrates with Lambda and Aurora.",Ideal for exposing backend services securely to external apps.,"Alternatives: EC2-hosted APIs, Kong Gateway – require more maintenance."
Apache Iceberg (GWDP),Open table format for huge analytical datasets on AWS.,Enables ACID transactions and schema evolution on S3.,Ideal for scalable and reliable data lakes.,Alternatives: Delta Lake or Hudi – similar but different feature sets.

Azure Service / Component,Purpose in Architecture,Why Chosen (Strengths),Best Fit For Use Case,Possible Alternatives & Trade-offs
Azure Data Lake Storage (via MS Fabric),Central storage for raw and processed data (data lake).,"Scalable, secure, cost-effective cloud storage with hierarchical namespace; integrates natively with Fabric and Synapse.",Ideal for storing structured/unstructured data at scale for analytics workloads.,"Alternatives: Azure Blob Storage (simpler, less suited for analytics); on-prem Hadoop HDFS (not cloud native)."
Azure Data Factory (ADF),"Data ingestion and orchestration service to extract, transform, and load data.",Fully managed ETL with drag-and-drop UI; integrates with 90+ data sources and Fabric.,Automates data movement between on-prem/cloud with low maintenance.,"Alternatives: Logic Apps (for event workflows), Synapse Pipelines (less flexible for hybrid data)."
Azure Databricks,"Data engineering, transformation, and machine learning platform.",Unified Apache Spark environment with autoscaling and Delta Lake integration; collaborative notebooks.,"Best for large-scale data prep, cleaning, and transformation using Python/SQL/Scala.","Alternatives: Synapse Spark Pools (tighter Fabric integration but less flexible), HDInsight (requires more management)."
"MS Fabric (OneLake, Data Warehouse, Data Engineering)","Unified SaaS analytics platform integrating data lake, ETL, and BI.","Combines capabilities of Synapse, Power BI, and Data Factory into one platform; no infrastructure management.",End-to-end data analytics lifecycle (storage → transformation → visualization).,Alternatives: Synapse Analytics + Power BI + ADF (modular but more complex setup).
Delta Lake (within Fabric / Databricks),"Provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel on data lake.",Ensures reliable data consistency and easy rollback; optimizes big data performance.,Ideal for maintaining consistent data lake architecture with versioning.,"Alternatives: Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi — similar capabilities but less native Azure support."
Data Pipelines (within Fabric),"Orchestrates workflows across ETL, data lake, and warehouse.",Low-code orchestration layer integrated with Fabric and ADF; built-in lineage and monitoring.,Streamlines complex data transformations and scheduling.,Alternatives: ADF pipelines (more flexibility but outside Fabric ecosystem).
Azure Key Vault,"Securely stores and manages secrets, encryption keys, and credentials.","Centralized secret management integrated with ADF, Databricks, and Fabric.",Ensures compliance and data protection in multi-service architecture.,Alternatives: Azure Managed HSM (hardware security module — more costly and complex).
Azure Active Directory (AAD),Central identity and access management for Azure services.,"Enables single sign-on, MFA, and RBAC; integrates seamlessly across Azure.","Ensures controlled access for users, APIs, and services.",Alternatives: On-prem AD with Federation — adds latency and maintenance.
Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control),Defines fine-grained access to Azure resources.,"Built-in, integrates with AAD; supports least-privilege principles.",Essential for secure multi-tenant or enterprise workloads.,Alternatives: Custom IAM implementations — riskier and harder to maintain.
Azure API Management (APIM),"Manages, secures, and scales APIs (Claims & Benefits APIs).","Centralized API gateway with caching, throttling, and analytics.",Simplifies secure exposure of backend services to web/mobile clients.,"Alternatives: Azure Front Door or Application Gateway — more suited for web traffic, not APIs."
GraphQL API (Member Video Service),Provides unified and flexible API interface for personalized video content (via SundaySky).,Efficient data fetching; enables personalized user experiences with fewer calls.,Ideal for custom member experience where multiple data sources are queried dynamically.,Alternatives: REST API — simpler but less efficient for dynamic frontends.
Power BI (with MS Fabric),Data visualization and business intelligence platform.,Native integration with Fabric; supports semantic models and real-time dashboards.,"Best for self-service analytics, KPI dashboards, and executive reporting.","Alternatives: Tableau, Qlik Sense — strong visualization but external integration required."
